# Python Portfolio Project: Insurance Charges Analysis

## Overview
This Python portfolio project focuses on analyzing an insurance dataset to gain insights into factors affecting medical charges. The dataset was obtained from MyCodeAcademy and serves as a practical exploration of Python for data analysis.

## Project Objectives
- **Work Locally:** The analysis was conducted on a local machine using Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Import Dataset:** Utilized Python to import the insurance dataset into the Jupyter environment.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated and interpreted descriptive statistics to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- **Correlation Matrix:** Created a correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables.
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Implemented multiple linear regression to predict medical charges based on various independent variables.
- **Code Organization:** Organized the analysis using functions or class methods for improved readability and maintainability.
- **Libraries Used:** Leveraged Python libraries, such as pandas, statsmodels, and numpy, to facilitate data analysis and modeling.
- **Documentation:** Documented the analysis process, including interpretations of statistical results.

## Project Structure
- **insurance.csv:** The dataset used for analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:**
  - **Descriptive_Statistics.ipynb:** Descriptive statistics calculations and interpretations.
  - **Correlation_Matrix.ipynb:** Creation and analysis of the correlation matrix.
  - **Multiple_Regression.ipynb:** Implementation of multiple linear regression for predicting charges.
  - **InsuranceAnalysis.py:** Python script containing class methods for data analysis.

## How to Run the Code
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas statsmodels numpy
